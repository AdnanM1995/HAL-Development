Sprint 7 Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
There is a lot of little things that get forgotten about that will eventually need to be fixed. This was a theme in the last sprint as well, but with everything being due all at the same time, it is definitely a lot to deal with. Every last minute bug or style error needing to be addressed really adds up. There was a running joke amongst the team early on. We would notice an issue and someone would say "yep, that's a clean-up sprint issue". Everyone would laugh, but it really caught up with us. Those little things alongside going back and ensuring all requirements for the project were met was a massive undertaking. In the last few days before the due date, every team member was regularily working on their code into 2 or 3 am. As stated last week: don't leave things for later. Make sure as much is complete now as absolutely possible. 

# What isn't going well
There were a few instances during this final sprint where a team member's issue they needed to address was dependant on code of another team member, and they just couldn't get ahold of them. Communication had been getting better for the whole duration of the project, but much of that progress reversed and teammates were not always available each other. We attribute this mostly to how busy the end of the year and graduation preparation is in general, but it did have a detrimental impact during certain stretches of this sprint. This is especially true when needing to check that everyone's code meets the final requirements.

# What the team can do better
Returning to the communication standards of past sprints, and to work much more closely on ensuring requirements are met and knowing that every teammate is on the same page with what needs to completed.

# What the team needs from others
Honest feedback from our professor. We worked hard on this project. We know it isn't perfect, but we put blood, sweat and tears into this project and want an honest assessment of the result. It's been a tough few terms, but the feeling of completing this project is amazing.
