Class Project Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
Amongst the team members, there was a lot of discussion about specific skill-sets that were learned or improved upon during this sprint. Specific examples of improved skills include ajax techniques, bootstrap strategies, working with event listeners in javascript, and likely most important of all: working with identity and being able to extract necessary information for our web application's needs. Outside of technical skill-sets, one member of the team recounted getting sick mid-sprint and then having to learn how to catch up in order to finish his stories before the deadline, and to ensure that his setback didn't bottleneck any other team member. A team member also noted that he learned something in regards to the expert work schedule planner. Namely, the nature of the value that a user story must provide to a potential user in order to match Agile's vision of a potentially shippable product.

# What isn't going well
The things that aren't going well generally fall into different shades of story set-up and prioritization. Namely, the major issues can be described as relating to the timing of starting projects, the order of starting them, and general prep and setup before starting a sprint. Team members recounted during the meeting that they wish they had taken on their bigger stories earlier as they felt that they had to crunch hard near the end to finish them. We didn't realize the effort or time disparities between some stories, and had we started with perceived harder stories earlier, we may have saved ourselves some headaches. The last two parts kind of go together. We weren't able to fully get to work on our stories until near the end of week 1 because we were playing catchup on finding the errors associated with the first sprint that were not solved. Because of this, we spent much of week 1 troubleshooting, which made some stories get started later, and resulted in the end crunch being even worse.

# What the team can do better
As with last week, much of what we feel we can do better stemmed from discussion following what wasn't going well. One thing was clear: if there is anything from a previous sprint preventing future work from getting done, scheduling to meet and work through it early is absolutely essential, and must be the protocol going forward. Beyond starting though, getting better at matching point values to actual time in order to estimate user story effort points will also be absolutely essential in ensuring that we don't have teammates coming near the end of a sprint and realizing that they need more time than they actually have. The final big takeaway for what could be done better is that the team could communicate more frequently, particularly when issues arise, so that they can be worked through sooner rather than later. The stand-up meetings happen regularly, but there are some stretches of time that go by outside of them where very little communication happens, and while that is fine if everything is proceeding smoothly, the same cannot be said if someone is encountering a problem. Because of this, the team made the decision to communicate more going forwards.

# What the team needs from others
Beyond hopping into the professor's office hours to have some technical questions answered about identity, there isn't anything that the team was able to think of that we need from others currently, but we will remain vigilant for if something arises.
