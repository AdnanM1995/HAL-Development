Sprint 6 Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
This is the final sprint for adding features to our project. For better or worse, whatever was finished at the end of this sprint would essentially be our final product. We all knew that going in. It's for that reason that the team was far more conservative when allocating points. No risky stories like the video chat from last sprint. As many features as we dream of being on our site, we had to set those desires aside and critically examine absolutely must be prioritized for our site to be considered "complete". The biggest realization is how many little loose ends from past sprints came back to bite us as we were trying to wrap everything up. Many tangents had to made to address little past issues that affected current implementation of our site as a complete web app. Moral of the story: make sure you account for future sprints when working on anything. Don't leave anything for later, as you may not have as much time as you think you do. Luckily though, the sprint largely went swimmingly, and we feel confident that our site is fully usable and complete as a matching service for IT issues. 

# What isn't going well
A lot of time being spent on cleaning up old issues was not very helpful with such a tight deadline. 

# What the team can do better
Going forward, we need to be critical with each other about whether a teammate's "good enough" for a story feature is going to be "good enough" for later stories that use those features. future proofing in general needs improvement. Being honest and more strict about requirements from all team members is a must.

# What the team needs from others
To ask the professor where to go in terms of finalizing our project in the final sprint.
