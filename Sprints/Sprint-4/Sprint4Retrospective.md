Sprint 4 Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
After becoming more familiar with unit testing in the last sprint, we now return to a full workload worth of points for each team member. Work on many of the key features of the site took place during this sprint, and coordination was the biggest challenge. The matchmaking feature requires simultaneous code being run on both the client and expert's machines with connecting code in the controller facilitating matching. Each team member got one of these pieces: expert code, client code, and connecting code. In theory, this was a good idea, but it made bringing everything together in the end very difficult, and in the end, we didn't see the completed result of any of the 3 due to the client-side code not being finished on time. A big takeaway is to limit such dependencies on other current stories, or to work much closer with others in the case that we have to have these big dependencies. 

# What isn't going well
Coordination and communication are fine for how our team operates generally, but our approach reached its breaking point with how intertwined these stories were.

# What the team can do better
Communicate every question, idea, or thought that a team member believes could possibly be useful or important to others. 

# What the team needs from others
To Discuss with the professor where to go from this point in terms of completing the client story and integrating it into the other two virtually-finished matching stories.
