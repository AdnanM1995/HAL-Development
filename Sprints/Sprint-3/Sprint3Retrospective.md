Class Project Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
A lot of the learning this week was focused on testing. A whole 2 points being allocated to each team member was required and as such, learning testing practices, conventions and strategies was the primary thing learned.

# What isn't going well
There were specific issues of not being able to interact with the database and allowing it to reflect changes that posed a large problem for some of the stories in the last sprint. As a larger and more overarching issue, time management and gauging how much work is left to be done on stories was an issue with several stories having to be worked on right up until the sprint deadline. 

# What the team can do better
Among the discussion, two big strategies to improve sprints were decided upon. Firstly, to make sure a firm grasp of material is understood before embarking on certain stories to make sure that common errors are addressed before they are implemented and giving the team headaches. secondly, being more staunch on keeping track of updating pivotal tracker and in general communicating with each other more as issues arise rather than letting them sit for two long.

# What the team needs from others
Aside from specific technical questions, there was not anything the team could determine was needed by others.
