Sprint 5 Retrospective
==================================================

# What the team learned
Approaching the end of feature-adding sprints, the team is set on getting as many key features finished as possible before the end of the term. A key goal of this project is the idea of implementing a live video chat service via WebRTC. A developer took this story on and was unprepared for the amount of work involved in realized it. In the end, the video chat feature was not finished. However, the team did finish a text-chat equivalent for meeting. It was agreed by all team members that this was a perfect example of the benefits of knowing what you are getting into before deciding to take on a given workload. the text-chat is only a single part of the initial vision of the site, but its inclusion is far more impactful than the lofty, but unrealistic voice and video chat feature, especially when the team has such a limited time to work on features. Accurate planning, time management, and being realistic are important skills when working on projects like this.

# What isn't going well
Communication has improved over the last few weeks, but point allocation and estimation of effort still needs work, as evidenced by the incomplete WebRTC video chat feature. 

# What the team can do better
The team can try to hold each other to make more realistic plans for a single sprint, or even individual stories. This is to make sure no one overexerts themselves and puts themselves in a position where they can't finish the work that others are relying on for future sprints.

# What the team needs from others
Nothing to note at the moment.
