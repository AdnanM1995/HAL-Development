Sprint 1 Retrospective
==================================================

# Retrospective Activity
For this sprint's retrospective activity, we used the Fun Retrospectives site's idea of a question roulette, Where one teammate would ask a question about the project, the sprint, or anything else, and a random teammate would answer it. Most of the questions ended up being very standard. "How did you feel about this?", "What would you do differently about that", and similar questions made up a lot of the activity. It was interesting getting an initial view of people's thought processes, in particular how stressful catching up from the power outage was for the majority of the team. It was also funny seeing the automated roulette algorithm appear to have a grudge against Jimmy, as his name was barely pulled over the course of the activity, to the point of becoming a running joke by the end.

# What the team learned
Two direct quotes from the team being asked what was learned this sprint: "How to deal with disasters" and "Power outages are bad". More specifically and to the point, the grand sentiment to this question is that the team learned just how much an unexpected event can completely derail carefully laid plans, and how we have to work together to try and overcome the unexpected challenge. After the inital power outage, most of the team was back up and running within 2 days, but it would take until 3 or 4 days in that the whole team would finally back with power and in their workstations. It took a lot of being flexible and working together to get the work done that we needed to. Besides this, there was also the sentiment that "just because you have a guide, doesn't mean implementing something will be easy." In the case that following along with one resource doesn't yield a working feature, it can be helpful to have other resources to turn to in order to figure out what you may be doing wrong.

# What isn't going well
Similar to the last question, much of the retrospective discussion was greatly affected by the power outage. Most teammates acknowledging that it is difficult to make definitive statements about what isn't going well, since the circumstances of this sprint was so abnormal, many of the issues may be more linked to the outage, and wouldn't actually be issues in a normal sprint. However, two suggestions came up. Namely integrating external resources like SendGrid has been problematic in terms of implementation, taking far longer than expected, and a realization that the team doesn't groom the product backlog until what is likely far too late into the Sprint, and thus coming into issues with very little time to go back and adjust the product backlog. 

# What the team can do better
Expanding on the previous question, we are planning on working on grooming meetings earlier, moving them to the Wednesday before a sprint's end. This is to counter the fatigue from the end of the week, and also force us to think about adding stories earlier on than the Friday schedule we currently have. 

# What the team needs from others
Given how much the power outage put the team back, we were not able to complete all of the stories assigned for sprint 1. We were aware that this would be the case when working on the backlog grooming meeting, but we were unsure if we were able to start looking towards moving uncompleted stories to the next sprint before the current one had ended. Should we allow that into our planning, if we can say with utmost certainty that those stories will not be finished? or should we plan as if we will complete the stories, and then place them back into the backlog when the sprint ends? We aren't planning on this becoming a common occurance, but if there is anytime that stories are going to be missed, a power outage spanning multiple days due to nasty weather is probably the time for it to happen.
