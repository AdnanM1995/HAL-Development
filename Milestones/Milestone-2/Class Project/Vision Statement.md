Vision Statement
==================================================

For people who have or require information about peaks or expeditions, as well as those who want to add accounts of their own expeditions, The Himalayan Database is an informative website that will act as the hub for all things expedition and climbing related. The Himalayan Database will contain the information regarding all major peaks on Earth, as well as the information on all known expeditions to take place on these peaks, and present it in a modern and readable format. Users will be able to search for information about peaks or past expeditions, as well as register accounts and submit their own expedition information to the database for others to search for. Alongside the siteâ€™s expedition database, The Himalayan Database will also contain recent information and news articles relating to climbing and expeditions, written by professionals. The Himalayan Database as it currently exists is not user friendly, and the information presented is difficult to understand, but after we finish upgrading the website, it will be easy enough for anyone to use effectively.
