GPS Map Volunteering
==================================================

A service designed to show users ways that they can get involved and help out in their community via volunteer opportunities and crowdfunding campaigns displayed as points on a GPS map where help is needed. This help may be in the form of physical volunteer help, or financial assistance for a community project. No money will trade hands with this app, but an option for the points of interest to include links to reputable crowdfunding sites will exist. Users can use our service to select locations for these points of interest and include a title, a description of what assistance is needed and at what time, an image, and even a color for the point of interest indicator based upon the category of needed assistance. Other users looking to better their community can input their location, view the GPS map and look for points of interest so that they can help out, with different categories being represented by different colored points of interest. Upon clicking on a point of interest, the user is presented with all of the information associated with the volunteer opportunity, as well as buttons to either bookmark the activity or RSVP for it. In the case of a crowdfunding campaign, the RSVP button is replaced with the link to the campaign. The user looking to help can also optionally view a list of the closest opportunities to the location that the user input.
 
Volunteering and crowdfunding sites currently exist, but they don’t generally operate in the same space online, despite both having the capacity to help out communities. They also aren’t usually grounded as such with a map. Being able to see the places in a community where help is needed gives them much more weight as users get to see and think of them as real places where they live. Our service aims to make people aware of the help that is needed right in their own neighborhoods in a way far more streamlined than other services. There’s a lot of help needed that people just don’t know about.

Major Features include: 
* GPS Map integration
* Ability to create and display listings of opportunities to help on the map 
* An account system that can keep track of bookmarked points of interest for each user
* Ability to link to outside crowdfunding sites
* A list created dynamically in order of the closest points of interest to the user’s location

In order to complete this project, we will need the use of an external API focusing on GPS and location information. An obvious choice is the Google Maps Platform, which we will look into using.

The algorithmic content in this project focuses on being able to utilize the GPS map feature and link volunteer listings to specific locations, as well as being able to compare distances between listings and the user to create a list of the closest listings. Additionally, algorithms must be created to manage the bookmarking system as well as user accounts. 

I would give this topic a difficulty rating of 5. While Google’s API is likely very user friendly, putting all of the parts together and having it function correctly will take a good deal of work.
