Vision Statement
==================================================

For individuals looking to find or provide IT help online, IT Matching is a web application giving the opportunity for those seeking IT help to be matched with those with the expertise needed in order to solve their IT-related problems. IT Matching will prompt users who need help to describe the nature of their IT or computing related issue and automatically connect them with professionals whose provided expertise matches the client’s issue. Once matched together in the system, IT Matching allows for the client and the expert to video chat one-on-one to come to a solution to the client’s IT-related issue. IT support online as it currently exists is generally either tied to a specific brand or product, or the support in question is too generalized to help with highly specific issues, but after we implement the IT Matching framework, our clients will have convenient and intuitive access to the help that they need.
