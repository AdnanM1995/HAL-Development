Possible Risks
==================================================

1. WebRTC Functionality:	Our project hinges on being able to correctly use WebRTC or the video components of our online meetings will be incredibly difficult to realize.

2. Matching Algorithm:		For our IT Matching service to be useful at all, the algorithm we implement needs to be correctly adjusted in order to match people with experts who can actually help them. If we can't do this, then the project will fail at its goal.

3. Two Kinds of Users: 		In our project, we have to account for not just one kind of user account, but two: general users and experts. Our web application needs to work correctly for people signed in as either. This may result in extended periods of testing for both user types.

4. Workload for 3 people:	While most teams have four members, ours has only three. Because of this, an ambitious project like this will take a bit more time and patience from all three of us in order to see it come to fruition.
