Team Project Ideas
==================================================

* **Patient/Doctor Matching**

  * A service designed to match patients with doctors for online consultations based upon the patient's symptoms. Both patients and doctors would have their own portal to log-in from, with patients being prompted to describe symptoms and doctors being prompted to list expertise. Our service would take the pool of patients and pool of doctors and calculate which doctor is best suited for a particular patient, and then allow for them to participate in a video call consultation, with possible functionality to make prescriptions, and print them.
 
* **Programming Central**

  * A website designed to act as a hub to those learning to program, titled Programming Central. It is a site for startup programmers who want to get into programming but have no idea where to start or what tools and references to use. However, because there are a variety of tools and references and tutorials we will only gather the most used/popular ones.

* **FAQ-Bot**

  * An AI service designed to filter out common user support questions by determining if a given user's question is similar enough to one previously answered. A user looking to ask a question will be prompted to submit their question into a text field and submit it. The AI service will look for patterns in the question that match questions previously answered in the past. If the question is deemed similar enough, then the user is presented with both the similar question asked as well as the user support's answer to the question. The user is then prompted to either return if their question has been adequately answered, or to continue to human user support if the AI failed to answer their question. If the AI does not see much similarity to previous questions at all, then the user is taken straight to human user support.
