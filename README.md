## IT Matching
This repository serves as the hub for all of HAL-Development's work on IT Matching as part of the senior project sequence for Western Oregon University's Computer Science Department. IT Matching is an Azure-hosted web application giving the opportunity for those seeking IT help to be matched with those with the expertise needed in order to solve their IT-related problems. IT Matching will prompt users who need help to describe the nature of their IT or computing related issue and automatically connect them with professionals whose provided expertise matches the client’s issue. Once matched together in the system, IT Matching allows for the client and the expert to video chat one-on-one to come to a solution to the client’s IT-related issue. 

## Key Features

* User accounts for both clients and experts
* Request-submission system for clients to describe and tag their IT issue
* Automated system that matches users based on a calculated "Matching Score"
* Live one-on-one text or video chat between clients and experts
* Rating system for clients to express how helpful they have found their matched experts to be

## Starting and Getting Matched

To get started, navigate to the register or log-in page of your choice in the top right. Register or log-in as either a client if you need IT assistance, or an expert to offer IT assistance to others. Finally, if you are a client, select "Create a Request" on the homepage and submit your IT help request. If you are an expert, click on the "Get Matched" button on the homepage to enter the waiting room and await your clients.
